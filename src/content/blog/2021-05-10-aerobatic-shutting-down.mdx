Dear valued customers,

We regret to inform you that the Aerobatic web hosting service is going to be **powered down on October 31, 2021**. This is a difficult decision, not least because we know you entrusted the hosting of your website to us, and we hate to let you down. However, the personal lives of the founders have evolved over the last 7 years we have been in operation and it is no longer tenable to run the business with the level of dedication and professionalism you deserve. We realize that this announcement requires you to take on some unplanned work to move your site to a different hosting provider.

While there are numerous options for hosting a static website, we suggest you look first at [Netlify](https://netlify.com) - a well-established (and well-funded) website platform that functions similarly to Aerobatic including much of the same functionality achieved via Aerobatic plugins including [auth](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/), [redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/), and [proxies](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/).

Wherever you plan to host your site, the best approach is to leave your site and custom domain with us while you get it working on the new provider. Once it looks good, you can update your DNS settings for your custom domain to point to the new location. At that point, you can safely go ahead and cancel your Aerobatic subscription.

You still have 6 months to migrate. Everything will continue to work as it does today up until October 31st. Any remaining active subscriptions will be terminated at that time.

While we wish we didn't have to break this news, we do sincerely thank you for your business over the last 7 years and hope that you have been satisfied with the service we provided.

Best Regards,

David and Jason
