At Aerobatic, we do our best to build great products for developers. However, as a developer, you also know that sometimes things can go wonky, despite our best efforts. When they do go wrong, it is our job as an add-on vendor to provide you with the proper support to get your Aerobatic add-on soaring again.

If you're experiencing an issue, or you wish to provide feedback, you can email us at [support@aerobatic.com](mailto://support@aerobatic.com) or contact us via [Slack](/slack).

This SLA is for informational purposes and does not engage Aerobatic LLC in any way. As with any software product - it is recommended that you test ANY new software on a non-production system prior to installing in a production system.

### Support Includes

- Incident Support - Identifying and troubleshooting problems with your add-on
- Assistance with issues during installation
- Assistance with issues during upgrades
- Guidance around implementation and configuration of the Aerobatic add-on

### Support Does Not Include

- Customers without a valid Aerobatic subscription
- Third-party application integrations or third-party plugins not distributed or sold by Aerobatic LLC.
- Product Training
- Non-English language support

### SLA for initial response to support queries

We are available for any questions, concerns, issues etc through our support channel at [support@aerobatic.com](mailto://support@aerobatic.com) as well as by reporting issues to us on [Slack](/slack).
