By submitting an online order form, or by using Aerobatic’s service, Customer hereby agrees to the following Privacy Policy. Customer agrees that it shall comply with and require its end users to comply with this Privacy Policy, Aerobatic’s Terms of Service (TOS), Aerobatic’s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and Aerobatic’s No-Spam Policy (NSP). In this document, the word “Agreement,” with a capital “A,” refers to the TOS, the AUP, the NSP, and the Privacy Policy collectively.

### 1. Introduction

Aerobatic respects the privacy of every individual who visits its Web sites and uses its services. This privacy statement provides notice of the standards and terms under which Aerobatic protects the privacy of information supplied by visitors to sites on the World Wide Web that are owned and operated by Aerobatic, including www.sustainablewebsites.com. This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information.

### 2. Personally Identifiable Information

Aerobatic typically receives specific data about its Web site visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card or electronic payment service to pay for Aerobatic services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information.

We collect the following types of information about you.

- Contact Information
- Name
- Company
- Email address

**Financial Information**

We do not collect any financial information. Aerobatic uses a third party service to process payments. At no time does Aerobatic ever store your credit card or other payment information. Our payment processor is Chargebee. You can review their security policy at https://www.chargebee.com/security.html

When you provide personally identifiable information to Aerobatic through one of our Web sites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. However, Aerobatic reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your Aerobatic services.

Aerobatic currently only sends service communication e-mails through www.aerobatic.com, and does not send marketing e-mails or newsletters through www.aerobatic.com. The service communication e-mails are essential to our registering you for service and to our continuing provision of services to you. Therefore, you may not opt out of receiving these e-mail messages.

Aerobatic will not, however, sell, trade, or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to any person. On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, Aerobatic will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and non-proprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, Aerobatic assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.

### 3. Non-Personally Identifiable (Generic) Information

In general, Aerobatic gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the Aerobatic sites visited. Aerobatic gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and Web site needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including “cookies” (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about Aerobatic services). Aerobatic does not combine information collected in this way with any personally identifiable information. You can set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it. However, refusing some cookies may make it impossible to use or navigate the Aerobatic Web site properly.

### 4. Your Aerobatic-Hosted Web Site, Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms and Third Party Sites

Information that you disclose in a public space, including on any bulletin board, chat room, or Web site that Aerobatic may host for you as part of your Aerobatic services, is available to anyone else who visits that space. Aerobatic cannot safeguard any information you disclose in these locations. Additionally, Aerobatic Web sites may contain links to sites that belong to third parties unrelated to Aerobatic. Aerobatic cannot protect any information you may disclose at these sites and recommends that you review the privacy policy statements of those sites you visit.

We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

### 5. Exceptions and Limitations

Notwithstanding the foregoing and in compliance with applicable laws, Aerobatic (i) cooperates fully with state, local, and federal officials in any investigation relating to any content (including personal or private electronic communications transmitted to Aerobatic) or purported unlawful activities of any user of the Aerobatic Service, and (ii) takes reasonable measures to protect its proprietary rights. For the limited purposes of accomplishing such cooperation and measures and in compliance with applicable laws, Aerobatic may be required to disclose personally identifiable information.

In addition, Aerobatic may elect to monitor the areas of communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate Aerobatic’s business; or (iii) to protect the rights or property of Aerobatic or others.

### 6. Sale or Transfer of Aerobatic’s Stock or Assets

In connection with the potential or actual sale or transfer of any of its interest in www.aerobatic.com, and other sites owned by Aerobatic, and any of the assets or stock of the company, Aerobatic reserves the right to sell or transfer your information (including, but not limited to, name, address information, and other information you provided to Aerobatic) to a third party that (i) concentrates its business in Web hosting or communication products or services; (ii) agrees to be Aerobatic’s successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of information collected and maintained by Aerobatic; and (iii) agrees to the obligations of this privacy statement. To the extent it is practicable to do so, this paragraph shall also apply in the event of any bankruptcy proceedings involving Aerobatic.

In the event that Aerobatic plans to transfer your information to a third party incident to a potential or actual sale of any of Aerobatic’s assets or stock, or incident to any bankruptcy proceedings involving Aerobatic, Aerobatic will:

Notify you by e-mail, at the e-mail address then on file for your account, at least thirty (30) days prior to the transfer taking place; and

Give you the opportunity to decide whether you wish for your information to be transferred to the third party. Please note, however, that if you choose not to allow your information to be transferred to the third party, you may have to terminate or cancel your service with Aerobatic. At the time of providing notice to you of the upcoming transfer of information to a third party, Aerobatic will tell you whether you will have to terminate or cancel your service, should you decide not to allow Aerobatic to transfer your information to the third party.
