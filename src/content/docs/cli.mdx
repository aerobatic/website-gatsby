The `aerobatic-cli` is a way to interact with the Aerobatic platform via the command line and the only way to deploy new versions. You can run it from your local machine, or from a build script in a [continuous deployment workflow](/docs/deployment/#continuous-deployment).

## Installation

The CLI is installed via npm:

<Cli>npm install aerobatic-cli --global</Cli>

### Usage

Once installed, the command `aero` should be globally available on your system. Running `aero help` will display a list of all the available commands:

```
Usage:
    $ aero [command] [options]

Commands:
    account        Display a summary of the current Aerobatic account.
    apikey         Get the api key for the current Aerobatic account.

#### aero account {#account-command}

Display a summary of the current Aerobatic account including the list of websites.

<Cli>aero account</Cli>

#### aero apikey {#apikey-command}

Get the api key for the current Aerobatic account. This value should be set as the `AEROBATIC_API_KEY` environment variable in a CI service. Read about [setting up a CI environment](/docs/deployment#aerobatic-apikey). Run with the `--reset` arg to reset to a new value.

**Options**

<Argument name="-R, --reset">Reset the account api key to a new value.</Argument>

**Examples**

<Cli commands={['aero account', 'aero account --reset']} />

#### aero clientip {#clientip-command}

Restrict website access to specific IP ranges using IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and/or CIDR blocks. Users whose IP address falls outside the specified ranges will receive a `401` error. [Read more](/docs/access-control/#client-ip-ranges).

**Options**

<Argument name="-v, --value">The comma delimited list of IPs and/or CIDR blocks.</Argument>
<Argument name="-s, --stage">The deploy stage to set the value for. Omitting this option sets it for all stages.</Argument>
<Argument name="-D, --delete">
Use this option to remove any client IP restrictions. To remove for a specific stage, also pass the `--stage` option.
</Argument>

**Examples**

<Cli
  commands={[
    'aero clientip --value "125.19.23.0/24,2001:cdba::3257:9652,62.230.58.1" # Set the IP ranges',
    'aero clientip --value myip # Lock it down to just your own current IP',
    'aero clientip --delete # Delete the IP range restrictions',
    'aero clientip --delete --stage test # Delete the IP ranges for the test stage'
  ]}
/>

#### aero create {#create-command}

Create a new Aerobatic website in the current directory. If no `aerobatic.yml` file exists in the current directory, a new one will created. If there is already an `aerobatic.yml` file, then the "id" property will overriden with the new website's unique identifier.

**Options**

<Argument name="-n, --name">

The desired name of the website. Names are globally unique and must be URL friendly (lower-case
letters, numbers, and dashes). If no name is specified then a random website name will be
generated for you. You can always use the [rename](#rename) command to change the name later.

</Argument>

<Argument name="-q, --quick-start">

The name of a quick start from the [Aerobatic Quick Start gallery](/quickstarts/jekyll/) to use to kickstart the website. Quick starts are available for Hugo, Jekyll, and vanilla HTML5.

</Argument>

<Argument name="-S, --source">
  URL to a `.tar.gz` archive to create the new website from. This will automatically create a new
  directory.
</Argument>

**Examples**

<Cli
  commands={[
    'aero create # Creates website at the current directory',
    'aero create -n website-name',
    'aero create --quick-start hugo/agency',
    'aero create --source https://html5up.net/editorial/download --name html5up-demo',
    'aero create -S https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-business-casual/archive/gh-pages.tar.gz'
  ]}
/>

#### aero delete {#delete-command}

Delete the website at the current directory. This will take down the website resulting in a 404 page. If the site is subscribed to the Pro plan, recurring payments will stop. You will be prompted to confirm the name of the website.

<Cli>aero delete</Cli>

#### aero deploy {#deploy-command}

Deploy a new version of the website in the current directory.

**Options**

<Argument name="-d, --directory">

Specify the sub-directory where the built website assets are located. This overrides any value specified in the `deploy` section of the `aerobatic.yml` file. If no value is specified in either location the current directory is deployed.

</Argument>

<Argument name="-s, --stage">

Specify the [deploy stage](/docs/overview#deploy-stages) for the deployment. This impacts the URL of the deployed version. For example passing `--stage test` will make the new version available at `https://www--test.customdomain.com` or `https://SITENAME--test.aerobaticapp.com`. If no value is provided then the deployment will target the production URL.

</Argument>

<Argument name="-m, --message">

A short message that you want to attach to the deployment metadata. If being [invoked from a CI server](/docs/deployment/#continuous-deployment), it may be useful to pass the git commit message and the URL to the commit details that triggered the build. This information will be displayed in the Aerobatic control panel as part of the deployment history. It will also be displayed in any email or Slack [deploy alerts](/docs/deployment/#deploy-alerts).

</Argument>

<Argument name="-c, --commit-url">

The URL to the commit that triggered this deployment. Also mostly useful when being invoked by a CI server. This URL will be linkable from the Aerobatic control panel.

</Argument>

**Examples**

<Cli
  commands={[
    'aero deploy',
    'aero deploy --directory _site',
    'aero deploy --stage test',
    'aero deploy --message "Commit message" --commit-url https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/2495349f'
  ]}
/>

#### aero domain {#domain-command}

Register a custom domain for the current website. This command requires that your website has already been upgraded to the Pro plan. If you want to run your website at the apex domain, i.e. `https://mydomain.com`, your DNS provider needs to support `ANAME` or `ALIAS` records. For details see the [apex domains docs](/docs/custom-domains-ssl/#apex-domains).

**Options**

<Argument name="-n, --name">
  The name of the domain (without any sub-domain, i.e. `mydomain.com`)
</Argument>

<Argument name="-N, --subdomain">
  The subdomain you want your website to be accessible at. For apex domain enter the value '@'. For
  wildcard domain enter '*'.
</Argument>

You can also run the command without any arguments to get status information on the domain as well as DNS details.

<Cli
  commands={[
    'aero domain --name mydomain.com --subdomain www',
    'aero domain --name mydomain.com --subdomain @',
    'aero domain'
  ]}
/>

#### aero env {#env-command}

Set or display environment variables for the website. By default variables are set for all deploy stages, but you can also override a value for a specific stage. You might want to do this with the [password-protect](/docs/plugins/password-protect/) to configure a different password for different stages. Or for the `url` property of the [http-proxy](/docs/plugins/http-proxy/) if you are proxying to a different API endpoint for test and production. Calling the command with no options will display all your variables.

<Argument name="-n, --name">The name of the environment variable</Argument>

<Argument name="-v, --value">The value of the environment variable.</Argument>

**Examples**

<Cli
  commands={[
    'aero env -n SITE_PASSWORD -v bigsecret',
    'aero env -n WIDGET_API_URL -v https://widgets-test/ --stage test',
    'aero env # Display all environment vars'
  ]}
/>

Read more about [configuration with environment variables](/docs/configuration/#environment-variables).

#### aero info {#info-command}

Display summary information about the current website.

<Cli>aero info</Cli>

#### aero login {#login-command}

Login to your Aerobatic account. You'll be prompted to enter your email and password. If your credentials are correct, a file is written at `~/.aerorc.yml` with an auth token that is passed in subsequent commands. The token is valid for 24 hours after which you'll be prompted to login again.

<Cli>aero login</Cli>

#### aero logs {#logs-command}

Tail the web logs for the current website. Gives a near real-time snapshot of the HTTP requests and responses being served from your site including geoip location.

By default the log entry output follows a format similar to the [Apache combined log format](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#combined) which displays a sub-set of the entire log entry:

```text
123.123.123.123     - 2017-03-13T15:44:11 - 200 - GET HTTP/1.1 - https://www.aerobatic.com/ - "Seattle, WA, US" - us-west-2
```

You can also call with the `--format json` option to see the entire JSON log entry:

```json
{
  "appId": "f593b673-75f2-4c7e-8a65-6e0d7a6e0f05",
  "awsRegion": "eu-central-1",
  "deployStage": "production",

```

<Cli commands={['aero logs', 'aero logs --format json']} />

#### aero rename {#rename-command}

**Options**

<Argument name="-n, --name">The new name of the website</Argument>

<Cli>aero rename -n new-website-name</Cli>

#### aero switch {#switch-command}
